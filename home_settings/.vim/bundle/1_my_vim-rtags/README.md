# Vim Rtags

Vim bindings for rtags.

https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags

# Requirements
1. Vim built with ```+python```.

# Installation
## Vundle
Add the following line to ```.vimrc```

    Plugin 'lyuts/vim-rtags'

then while in vim run:

    :source %
    :PluginInstall

## NeoBundle
Add the following line to ```.vimrc```

    NeoBundle 'lyuts/vim-rtags'

then while in vim run:

    :source %
    :NeoBundleInstall

## Pathogen
    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/lyuts/vim-rtags

# Configuration
This plugin interacts with RTags by invoking ```rc``` commands and interpreting
their results.  You can override the path to ```rc``` binary by setting
```g:rcCmd``` variable.  By default, it is set to ```rc```, expecting it to be
found in the $PATH.

Out of box this plugin provides mappings. In order to use custom mappings the
default mappings can be disabled:

    let g:rtagsUseDefaultMappings = 0

By default, search results are showed in a location list. Location lists
are local to the current window. To use the vim QuickFix window, which is
shared between all windows, set:

    let g:rtagsUseLocationList = 0

## Unite sources

This plugin defines three Unite sources:
* `rtags/references` - list references (i.e., &lt;Leader&gt;rf).
* `rtags/symbol` - find symbol (i.e., &lt;Leader&gt;rs). Use `rtags/symbol:i`
  for case insensitibe search.
* `rtags/project` - list/switch projects.

## Code completion
Code completion functionality uses ```completefunc``` (i.e. CTRL-X CTRL-U). If ```completefunc```
is set, vim-rtags will not override it with ```RtagsCompleteFunc```. This functionality is still
unstable, but if you want to try it you will have to set ```completefunc``` by

    set completefunc=RtagsCompleteFunc

# Notes
1. This plugin is wip.
1. Code completion with rtags is not done yet. Completion does not work when invoked right after '.' (dot), '::' (scope resolution operator), therefore requires typing at least one character before invocation.

# Development
Unit tests for some plugin functions can be found in ```tests``` directory.
To run tests, execute:

    $ vim tests/test_rtags.vim +UnitTest
